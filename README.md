# Image-Caption-generation
Creating a model that derives a description of an image.
Utilized COCO 2017 Dataset image dataset. 
To run the notebook, download it and upload to kaggle and in input space add the path to COCO 2017 dataset and the path to any pretrained model of inception_v3_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5 since the url to this model is not accessible through the tensorflow.keras.InceptionV3 library. The necessary code to implement this model without the library is already provided within.
here is a link to the pretrained inception_v3 model : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisjimenezquesada/pretrained-models
use this in the input space
